# AdMob Account Setup & Approval Guide

## Current Status: Account Not Approved Yet ⏳

Your AdMob account is in the approval process. This is normal for new accounts.

## Error Code 3: "Account not approved yet"

```
Ad failed to load : 3
Account not approved yet. <https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9905175#1>
```

### What This Means

Google AdMob requires account verification before serving real ads. This process typically takes:
- **24-48 hours** for initial review
- **Up to 7 days** in some cases
- Automatic once your account meets requirements

## ✅ Solution: Use Test Ads During Development

### Current Configuration

The app is now configured to use **Google's test ad units**:

**File:** `lib/services/app_open_ad_manager.dart`
```dart
static const bool _useTestAds = true; // Currently using test ads
```

**Test Ad Units:**
- Android: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/9257395921`
- iOS: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5575463023`

These test ads will:
- ✅ Load successfully
- ✅ Display properly
- ✅ Let you test the implementation
- ✅ Don't require account approval
- ❌ Don't generate real revenue

## 🎯 When to Switch to Production Ads

### Step 1: Check Account Approval Status

1. Go to [AdMob Console](https://apps.admob.com/)
2. Check for approval notification
3. Look for "Account Status" in settings

### Step 2: Update the App

Once approved, change this line in `app_open_ad_manager.dart`:

```dart
static const bool _useTestAds = false; // Switch to production
```

Your real ad units will then be used:
- Android: `ca-app-pub-6648737877378523/9996806950`
- iOS: `ca-app-pub-6648737877378523/9996806950`

## 📋 AdMob Account Requirements

To get approved, your AdMob account needs:

### 1. Account Information ✅
- Valid email address
- Payment information added
- Tax information (for payouts)

### 2. App Requirements
- App published on Google Play or App Store
- Privacy policy URL
- App content complies with AdMob policies
- App has actual users (not just test accounts)

### 3. Policy Compliance
- No prohibited content
- No invalid traffic
- Proper ad implementation
- No accidental clicks

## 🧪 Testing with Test Ads

### How to Test

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **You should see:**
   - ✅ "App Open Ad loaded successfully!" in logs
   - ✅ Test ads display when app opens/resumes
   - ✅ "Google Test Ad" watermark on ads

3. **Test scenarios:**
   - Launch app (first time)
   - Background and resume app
   - Enable/disable Pro status

### Expected Test Ad Behavior

Test ads will:
- Load every time (no frequency caps)
- Display consistently
- Show "Test Ad" label
- Not count toward earnings

## ⚠️ Important: Don't Click Your Own Ads

**Once using production ads:**
- ❌ Never click your own ads
- ❌ Don't encourage others to click
- ❌ Don't use automated clicking
- ✅ Use test ads for development
- ✅ Add your device as a test device

### How to Add Test Device

Update `app_open_ad_manager.dart`:

```dart
final testRequest = AdRequest(
  testDevices: ['YOUR_TEST_DEVICE_ID'], // Get from AdMob logs
);
```

## 📊 Monitoring Account Status

### Check Approval Status

**AdMob Console Dashboard:**
- Go to: https://apps.admob.com/
- Look for: "Account Status" indicator
- Check: Email for approval notification

### Common Approval Delays

**Account might take longer if:**
- App not yet published
- Missing privacy policy
- Insufficient app information
- Previous policy violations

### Speed Up Approval

**To expedite:**
1. ✅ Publish app to Play Store/App Store
2. ✅ Add detailed app description
3. ✅ Include privacy policy link
4. ✅ Fill out all AdMob account information
5. ✅ Verify payment details
