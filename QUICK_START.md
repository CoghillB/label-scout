## 🎯 Next Steps (DO THIS NOW)

### 1. Generate Hive Adapters (REQUIRED)

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will create `scan_history_item.g.dart` which is needed to compile.

### 2. Test the App

```bash
flutter run
```

**What to Test:**
- Scan a product → Check if it saves to history
- Go to History tab → See your scans
- Try the filter chips (All, SAFE, CAUTION, AVOID)
- Swipe to delete a history item
- Feel the vibration when scanning (on real device)
- Test Pro features with the toggle in Settings

### 3. Add Your App Icon (When Ready)

1. Create a 1024x1024px PNG icon
2. Save it as: `assets/icon/app_icon.png`
3. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
   flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
   ```
