# Profile Selection Fix - Summary

## Problem
Users were experiencing a glitchy popup when trying to scan before selecting a dietary profile. The popup would appear AFTER the camera view opened, creating a jarring user experience.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Proactive Profile Checking in Scanner Screen
**File Modified:** `lib/screens/scanner_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Converted `ScannerScreen` from `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget`
- Added profile checking on screen initialization
- Display real-time profile status with visual indicators:
  - ✅ **Green indicator** when profile(s) are active
  - ⚠️ **Orange warning** when no profile is selected
- Check profile before opening camera
- Show smooth bottom sheet prompt if no profile is selected (instead of allowing camera to open)

### 2. User Experience Improvements

#### Before:
1. User taps "Scan Barcode"
2. Camera opens
3. User scans a product
4. **GLITCH**: Popup appears saying "No Profile Selected"
5. User has to close dialog and navigate back

#### After:
1. User sees profile status immediately on scanner screen
2. If no profile:
   - Orange warning badge shows "No dietary profile selected"
   - Button still works but triggers smooth bottom sheet
   - Bottom sheet explains what they need to do
   - User taps "Got It" and navigates to Profiles tab
3. If profile is active:
   - Green badge shows "Active profile: [Name]"
   - User taps "Scan Barcode"
   - Camera opens immediately (no interruptions)

### 3. Safety Measures Maintained
The barcode scanner view (`barcode_scanner_view.dart`) still has the profile check as a **fallback safety net**. This defensive programming ensures:
- If someone navigates directly to the scanner (bypassing the main screen)
- If a profile gets cleared while the camera is open
- The app still handles it gracefully

## Benefits

### User Experience
- ✅ **No more glitchy popups**
- ✅ **Clear visual feedback** about profile status
- ✅ **Smoother onboarding** for first-time users
- ✅ **Proactive guidance** instead of reactive errors
- ✅ **Pull-to-refresh** to update profile status

### Technical
- ✅ **Defensive programming** with dual-layer checks
- ✅ **State management** for profile status
- ✅ **Clean separation** of concerns
- ✅ **Zero compilation errors**
