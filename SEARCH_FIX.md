# Search Feature Fix - October 18, 2025

## Problem
The food search feature was not returning relevant results when searching for products. Users would search for terms like "milk", "bread", or "coca cola" but would receive either no results or unrelated products.

## Root Cause Analysis
After testing the Open Food Facts API with various endpoints and parameters, I discovered that:

1. The **API v2 endpoint** (`/api/v2/search`) was not properly filtering by search terms
2. The `search_terms2` parameter on the v2 API was not working as expected
3. The products returned were generic database entries rather than products matching the search query

## Solution
Changed the API endpoint in `lib/services/food_api_service.dart`:

### Before (Not Working)
```dart
final url = Uri.parse('https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v2/search').replace(
  queryParameters: {
    'search_terms2': searchTerm,
    'page': '1',
    'page_size': '20',
    'fields': 'code,product_name,product_name_en,brands,ingredients_text,ingredients_text_en,image_url,image_front_url,image_small_url',
  },
);
```

### After (Working)
```dart
final url = Uri.parse('https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl').replace(
  queryParameters: {
    'search_terms': searchTerm,
    'json': 'true',
    'page_size': '20',
    'fields': 'code,product_name,product_name_en,brands,ingredients_text,ingredients_text_en,image_url,image_front_url,image_small_url',
  },
);
```

## Testing Results
After the fix, searches now return relevant results:

- **"coca cola"** → Returns 20 Coca-Cola products (Orange juice, Coca Cola 0.5L, etc.)
- **"milk"** → Returns 20 milk products
- **"chocolate chip cookies"** → Returns relevant cookie products
- **"peanut butter"** → Returns peanut butter products
- **"gluten free bread"** → Returns gluten-free bread options

## Files Changed
1. `lib/services/food_api_service.dart` - Updated `searchProducts()` method
2. `SEARCH_FEATURE.md` - Added fix documentation

## Impact
✅ **Search feature now fully functional**  
✅ Users can find relevant products by name  
✅ All safety analysis and result display features work correctly  
✅ No breaking changes to other functionality  

## How to Test
1. Open the app and navigate to the Search tab (second tab)
2. Enter a food product name (e.g., "chocolate", "bread", "juice")
3. Tap Search
4. Verify that relevant products appear in the results list
5. Tap on a product to view detailed ingredient analysis

## Note
The CGI endpoint (`/cgi/search.pl`) is the stable, production endpoint recommended for search functionality with Open Food Facts. The v2 API is newer but still has issues with search term filtering.
