4. Notice the switch turns amber/gold

### Test Saving Items:
1. Go to Scanner tab
2. Scan a product barcode
3. View result screen showing product info
4. Click "Save to My Lists"
5. Select a category (e.g., "Snacks")
6. See confirmation snackbar

### View Saved Lists:

## ❌ Intentionally Excluded

As per requirements, these are NOT implemented:
- Actual IAP integration with Apple/Google
- Ad integration/removal logic
- Multiple active diet profiles
- Real ingredient analysis (shows placeholder "safe" status)

## 🚀 Next Steps

For the next development phase, you could implement:
1. Ingredient analysis algorithm
2. Multiple profile support
3. In-app purchases integration
4. Ad integration (Google AdMob)
5. Scan history tracking
6. Cloud sync for saved lists
7. Export/import functionality

## 📝 Technical Notes

- **Hive Database**: Fast, local NoSQL database - no server needed
- **Type Safety**: All models are strongly typed
- **Generated Code**: Hive adapters auto-generated via build_runner
- **State Management**: Uses StatefulWidget for real-time updates
- **Navigation**: Material page routes throughout
- **Persistence**: All data survives app restarts

## ✨ User Experience Highlights

1. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Icons, colors, and text clearly indicate Pro status
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Free users see what they're missing without breaking UX
3. **Smooth Flow**: Scan → View → Save → Organize is intuitive
4. **Professional Design**: Consistent with app's color scheme
5. **No Dead Ends**: Every action has a clear next step or outcome

**Status**: ✅ All Pro features (My Lists) successfully implemented and ready for testing!
